## üß† Self-Reflection

### What I Learned
- How to structure a complete portfolio website using semantic HTML
- Creating a responsive layout that works on different screen sizes
- Implementing smooth scrolling navigation between sections
- Designing a cohesive color scheme and typography system
- Using CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout

### Challenges I Faced
- Ensuring the navigation worked correctly with smooth scrolling
- Creating a responsive design that looks good on all devices
- Balancing content across different sections
- Implementing hover effects without making the interface too busy

### Use of AI or External Help
- Used W3Schools for CSS Grid and Flexbox references
- Referenced MDN Web Docs for semantic HTML elements
- Used ColorHunt for the soothing color palette inspiration

### If I Had More Time‚Ä¶
- I would add more interactive elements with JavaScript
- Implement a dark/light mode toggle
- Add actual project images instead of placeholders
- Create a more detailed blog section with actual articles
- Add a skills section with progress bars or charts
